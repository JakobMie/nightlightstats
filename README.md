# nightlightstats

This R package allows calculating user-specified statistics or creating a plot for a region's nightlight data for a given time period. The nightlight data are from the "Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, NOAA/NCEI" (Image and data processing by NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center. DMSP data collected by US Air Force Weather Agency). You can either work with yearly DMSP data ranging from 1992 to 2013 (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html) or monthly VIIRS data beginning in Apr 2014 (https://eogdata.mines.edu/download_dnb_composites.html). You can either provide own shapefiles (region, country, etc.) or have them (in the case of countries) automatically downloaded from GADM (https://gadm.org/data.html). The package allows to perform calculations  on night light data and build databases for any given region using the function "nightlight_calculate". Plots of the night lights in the desired area are also made very easy with "nightlight_plot". You can either work with yearly data ranging from 1992 to 2013 (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html) or monthly data beginning in Apr 2014 (https://eogdata.mines.edu/download_dnb_composites.html). At the time of writing, the yearly VIIRS data is not uploaded so the package doesn't process yearly VIIRS data. Please contact the authors if you notice that this changed. You can either provide own shapefiles (region, country, etc.) or have them (in the case of countries) automatically downloaded from GADM (https://gadm.org/data.html). See the helpfiles for a detailed description of the functions and their arguments.
