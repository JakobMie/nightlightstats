Description: This R package allows calculating user-specified statistics or creating a plot for a region's night light satellite data for a given time period. The nightlight data are from the "Earth Observation Group, Payne Institute for Public Policy, NOAA/NCEI" (Image and data processing by NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center. DMSP data collected by US Air Force Weather Agency). You can either work with yearly DMSP data ranging from 1992 to 2013 (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html) or monthly VIIRS data beginning in Apr 2014 (https://eogdata.mines.edu/download_dnb_composites.html). You can either provide own shapefiles (region, country, etc.) or have them (in the case of countries) automatically downloaded from GADM (https://gadm.org/data.html). At the time of writing, the yearly VIIRS data is not uploaded so the package doesnâ€™t process yearly VIIRS data. Please contact the authors if you notice that this changed.
